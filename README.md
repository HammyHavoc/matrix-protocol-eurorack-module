# matrix-protocol-eurorack-module
Open source decentalized audio, MIDI and control voltage via [Matrix protocol](https://github.com/matrix-org) with collaborators, friends, family, strangers, and enemies. Create a globe-spanning Eurorack synth patch or experiment with modules from afar. Embrace serendipity.

Choose what Matrix space you want to connect to. Spaces can federate with each other. Keep it private with one-on-one sessions, scale up to get your whole band involved, or go global with new realms of scalable decentralized open sourcery.

## Sidecar Eurorack modules
Expand your capabilities with additional Eurorack modules to tailor the experience to your needs or tasteâ€”it's all valid.

### Patchbay/switchboard module
Optionally add a means of interacting with large numbers of audio, MIDI and CV broadcasts. Want to go even further? Bank through rows of your sockets as virtual pages.

### Comms module
Optionally add a microphone, webcam and display in a compact module. Chat with your collaborators naturally or send someone the output of your video synthesizer modules.

### Expansion module
Optionally add USB sockets via an expansion module for class-compliant audio interface and MIDI-USB host support.

### Increase the number of signals you can broadcast and receive simultaneously with more Matrix protocol Eurorack modules
Group multiple Matrix protocol Eurorack modules together as a single virtual synth for easy visualization and remote collaboration.

## Software
Declarative and reproducible configurations to encourage experimentation, sharing and pull requests. Screw up? Boot into a different version of your configuration at startup.
